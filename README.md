Explain how to launch the app

TODO move gift fetching to the api folder and only call mongo from there. Have an app + port parameters there

1. Launch mongo
2. Launch external json gifts API
3. Launch server
4. Test API in Postman
5. Monitor in MongoDB Compass

Server -> app -> mongo -> getUpdatedListOfGifts -> launches app actually
